## Summary

This books is the third volume in the series `The Theoretical Minimum` 
and is designed to teach readers the minimum concepts and mathematics
needed to understand:
- Einstein's Special Relativity
- Classical Field Theory 

It uses real equations and you must be familiar with calculus and tensor
notation rather than a pure verbal description.
